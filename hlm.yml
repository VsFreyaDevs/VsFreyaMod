# swag  little helper for haxelib, allowing you to specify, install, and update your libaries using
# lib.haxe.org libs, git, or dev (local path ref) libraries, locally from a hlm.yml file
# inspired by hmm and hxPKG
# also yes this is a mockup, im planning out on working on this lol
libs:
  - name: examplelib # the name of the library, REQUIRED FOR ALL LIBS
        type: haxelib # can be haxelib, dev or git, REQUIRED FOR ALL LIBS
        version: 9.2.2 # the version of the library, optional but kinda a bad practice not to include it when referencing a library
        link: https://github.com/charlesisfeline/examplelib # github/gitlab/git.gay link, REQUIRED FOR GIT LIBS
        ref: master # either a branch or a hash, optional for git libs
        directory: src # the folder of the library's source code, optional for git libs
        path: /milky/path/examplelib # the file system path of the library's source code, REQUIRED FOR DEV LIBS
        # also dev dependencies are allowed for convenience, however not as ideal since they do not specify any versioning,
        # and require others to have the same local directory
