A kitsune version of BF was walking in the kit world when he stumbles upon [FreyaFennec_foxes](https://www.youtube.com/@Freyafennec_foxes1.0) and her crew. Turns out this version of BF is actually a Freya hater and simps for [Mika_kit](https://www.youtube.com/@Mika_Kit162). He rap battles them under one condition: if he wins, he kills her.

## Kitsune Engine
Kitsune Engine is a fork of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) made to fix some problems the base game had while keeping the casual aspect of said game.

Kitsune Engine is an *engine* that's basically like those old engines from 2021-2022, only refactoring some of FNF's code and serving as an option for people who want more settings and customizability while keeping up with the latest base FNF updates.

By the way, Kitsune Engine also supports mobile devices, too!
