You have to add your fork as a remote, you can do this by doing:

And then, you can commit your changes and push them to the branch `develop` or any branch you want to push to.

Then, you can create a pull request on github, where you'll want to merge your branch to the target branch you're pushing to.

Then, the Vs. Freya developers will review your branch and approve or dissaprove/comment the changes, and eventually merge.

Happy contributing!
