# FIX KNOWN BUGS
- [x] Characters in the Character select menu keep cloning themselves
- [x] A-bot Visualizer doesn't react to volume
- [ ] The HaxeUI part of the Character Offset Editor isn't showing up
- [ ] Backspace crashes in the input offset menu
- [ ] DJ Boyfriend/Pico flickering, for some reason
- [x] You can die during the cutscenes in Week 3's Pico mixes
- [ ] Scripts are able to modify Variables in the `funkin/utils/Constant.hx` file (I guess it's because of how HScript does variable shit, maybe this should be fixed in a fork instead???)
